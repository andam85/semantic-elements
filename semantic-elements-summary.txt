Semantic elements are objects supported by HTML5 whose name are both understood by both the Browser and the Developers.
A major benefit of using semantic elements while coding is that it is a standard better understood by both machines and people.
Using semantic elements allows machines to scan the HTML document easier to understand the site contents.
The benefits extend to distributing or sharing your work to other developers as well.
Rather than trying to understand the function of each specific divits, when developers see semantic tags, the name itself suggests the function of it.
